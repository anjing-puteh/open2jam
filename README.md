It's been a while since I last messed with the source but it's basically the same as the original open2jam but with some minor changes:
- Modified the speed modifier to 0.05 instead of 0.5.
- Added Blind mode to visibility modifier (reverse dark, covers middle section of the note panel).
- Modified the judgement behavior to match o2jam, well... sort of.
- Added some extra information to the playing screen i.e accuracy calculation based on osu!mania, speed modifier, etc
